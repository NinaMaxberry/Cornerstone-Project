Every ten years, the US Census Bureau conducts a survey to measure changes (+/-) in several areas of the economy across the country. These areas include concentrations or shifts in population, employment, income, poverty and many other areas.  One of the areas that are affected by the census is your voting rights or more formally stated how voting district boundaries are drawn.

Each zip code points to a county in Kentucky and the counties are grouped into one of six congressional districts.  We will look at the representatives from the 110th Congress (year 2000) with your zip code and compare them with your present representatives (116th Congress) of today.
